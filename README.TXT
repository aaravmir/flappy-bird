I really enjoyd this coding experience and had a great time making this game, it even motivated me to make more games this summer just for fun!
I always played flappy bird as a kid so thats where I got the inspiration from, and I added my own tweaks to it. The thing that was the most 
challenging for me was something I wasnt even able to do: Coding a second chance world, where if you collect 3 or more fruits in the game, 
instead of dying, you get a second chace and respawn where you were with the original score. This was hard as I only got to the point of collecting
the fruit, but no way of measuring how many I collected. I will tryto fix this now, just for fun and for a little challenge. Overall I am very
grateful for this experience as I have learned alot of valuable lessons and tricks and tips!
